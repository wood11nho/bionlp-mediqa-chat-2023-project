       "[doctor] hi dax. how are you? [patient] i'm doing very well. [doctor]: i'm good. i'm just having a heart attack six months ago, coronary artery disease, diabetes. so i'm having a little heart attack 6 months ago and i had to have a stent placement at the left anterior descending artery. so, i've been having some problems with my blood pressure and my cholesterol and triglycerides but i'm not sure what's going on with that because i'm from the west coast and i'm a San Francisco 49ers fan and i to watch the 49ers games and i love to watch them but i have a little bit of a problem with my cholesterol because i have high cholesterol and high triglycerides and my triglycerides are high and i have to take a lot of medications to get my cholesterol up to the high level of normal, but i do n't know if that's related to the heart attack or if it's just medication related or something that but i think it's something that's just going on in my body and i just need to get it under control and i'll be able to get some relief from it and then i can go back to my normal routine of taking my medications and taking my heart medication and i can feel my heart rate going up and down but i still have some muscle aches and headaches and i feel i'm going to have to go to the bathroom and take some ibuprofen but i can't do that because my heart is really high and it's really hard to breathe so i just have to stay in bed and take my medication and then when i wake up i'll go to bed and i will take my aspirin and i take my tylenol and i go to sleep and i do to sleep but when i get up i get really dizzy and my headache gets really bad and my headaches get worse and worse and i start to get really nauseous and my fever gets really high so i try to stay asleep but i just can't get to sleep because i just feel I'm in a really bad mood and i want to get out of bed and get some rest (doctor] okay. and then what about your blood pressure? how is it doing with your heart and your cholesterol and your triglycerides? how are your blood pressures doing\n",
