       "[doctor] hi dax. how are you? [patient] i'm doing very well. [doctor]: i'm good. i'm just having a heart attack six months ago, coronary artery disease, diabetes. so i'm having a little heart attack 6 months ago and i had to have a stent placement at the left anterior descending artery. so, i've been having some problems with my blood pressure and my cholesterol and triglycerides but i'm not sure what's going on with that because i'm from the west coast and i'm a San Francisco 49ers fan and i to watch the 49ers games and i love to watch them but i have a little bit of a problem with my cholesterol because i have high cholesterol and high triglycerides and my triglycerides are high and i have to take a lot of medications to get my cholesterol up to the high level of normal, but i do n't know if that's related to the heart attack or if it's just medication related or something that but i think it's something that's just going on in my body and i just need to get it under control and i'll be able to get some relief from it and then i can go back to my normal routine of taking my medications and taking my heart medication and i can feel my heart rate going up and down but i still have some muscle aches and headaches and i feel i'm going to have to go to the bathroom and take some ibuprofen but i can't do that because my heart is really high and it's really hard to breathe so i just have to stay in bed and take my medication and then when i wake up i'll go to bed and i will take my aspirin and i take my tylenol and i go to sleep and i do to sleep but when i get up i get really dizzy and my headache gets really bad and my headaches get worse and worse and i start to get really nauseous and my fever gets really high so i try to stay asleep but i just can't get to sleep because i just feel I'm in a really bad mood and i want to get out of bed and get some rest (doctor] okay. and then what about your blood pressure? how is it doing with your heart and your cholesterol and your triglycerides? how are your blood pressures doing\n",

He notes when he stands after he has been sitting for a while, he has to use a cane to \"get his bearings.\" The injection he received to the right knee at the last visit was only beneficial for a few weeks. The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not attended physical therapy.\r\n",

Then the right knee was prepped in a standard fashion. The right knee was injected with 80 mg triamcinolone and 1 mL lidocaine. The procedure was tolerated well with no complications.

       "[doctor] hi, mr. Nelson. how are you? [patient] i'm doing okay. how about you? how are your knee? [doctor]: i'm good. i'm glad to see you. how's your right knee? i've been sitting for a while now, but i have to use a cane to get my bearings. so, i'm sorry to hear that you're having some knee pain and swelling, but it's been going on for about a couple of weeks now. i've had a steroid injection to my right knee at the last visit, and it helped a little bit, but the pain level is still a little high. (doctor] okay. and how long have you been sitting? and have you had any pain in your knee since the last time i saw you? i mean, , about a week and a half ago. and it's just been bothering me for a little while now. and, , i've noticed a lot of pain in my knee, and i think it's because i'm sitting on a cane, and when i stand, it hurts to get around. and i've used a support hose, which helps to some degree, but when i sit, it's a little sore. and then when i get up, i use a walker to get to my feet. and sometimes it hurts for a few weeks, and then it gets better. and finally, i can get up and go to the bathroom, but that's about it. and so, , i do n't go to physical therapy anymore. i just sit on a stool, and that's it. i try to get off the stool, but sometimes i just have to sit down, and the pain gets a little worse. and the other times it gets worse and worse. i do have to walk around a lot, and sometimes i even have to put a cane on it, but nothing helps at all. and when you stand, you have to stand, and you can use a walking stick to get your bearings. and if you're able to walk, you can do that, but if you can't walk, that's okay.\n",
